        "image": "stackoverflow.jpeg",
        "Description": "Developed a Search Engine on Stackoverflow Data based on the semantic meaning of the question. When a user searches any question then the search engine would give the most similar results based on semantic meaning rather than keyword matching. The main task of this project is to understand the content of what the user is trying to search for and then return the most similar results in minimal time based on the user’s query using semantic similarity. Glove pre-trained vectors, TF-IDF, Gensim Word2Vec model, and Tensorflow Hub module have been used for sentence encoding. To similarity measure, Cosine similarity has used. Deployed the whole project on Heroku and made it end to end for a better experience. Published a Blog on medium explaining my approach to this project",

Pre-trained Glove Vectors with 300d has been used for text embeddings. Model built using Keras functional API.",

Dataset Size was too large, Almost around 200 GB. Out of which 50GB of data was bytes files and 150GB of data was asm files. The main objective of this project is to minimize multiclass log loss as much as possible. I got a minimum logloss of 0.001. To get this much minimum log loss I made some high-level features like image feature from byte file and asm file etc. I have also used some feature selection techniques like the Chi-Square test etc.",
